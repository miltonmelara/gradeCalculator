# Grade Calculator

## Project description:

Create a calculator that can **calculate your zone when you enter your grades of portfolios and from exams**. I'm currently using *JavaScript* to make the calculator work. I'm aiming to launch it as soon as I can make it work on *HTML*.

## To-do:

1.Check if any modification is required

2.Check if anything else could be implemented on the JS.

3.Add HTML and CSS and link them to the JS file so it can be used from GitHub Pages.

4.Publish it on GitHub Pages.
